HOW TO OPERATE:

If calling the function from somewhere else make sure you include:

from tagging import process_image

*This is the only import you should need.*

This version automatically installs all packages needed to run, so no need to worry.

All permissions are taken care of automatically.

The function you will call is called process_image("filepath to image")
The parameter you pass to process_image MUST be the complete filepath to the image you wish to use.

For a demo call the function process_image_demo(), everything needed is contained within the tagging folder.

When the tagging process is complete the map search is displayed in a new tab.

To run this program by itself remove the '#' in front of the process_image_demo() command at the bottom of the
process_image.py file

After this you may run process_image.py which should activate the demo
